# Structure
- 3 material planes each given to a main race, Edesi for humans (the one the campaign starts in), Hydenweald for elves and The Wasteland for dwarves, cross-plane travel has been established for a long time so all races can be found everyone, but the most common race is the one the plane is attributed to
- The human realm is divided into 3 main city-states: Daekar, Vellir and Mecha. There is also the Anapat Desert which is largely uninhabitable.
- Similar to Final Fantasy, the world is permeated by different aspects/elements of aether, the two raw forms of aether are light and dark which when woven together can create elemental aether based on how it is woven. All spells are cast using this elemental aether, for D&D this doesn't change spellcasting at all and is only for lore purposes.
- Aether can be woven together by the will of living creatures, however the amount of aether that can be acquired this way is limited, standard spells will work fine, but Rituals will have to be done in areas with naturally high concentrations of aether.

## Nexus
- Each city has a Nexus, an blessing from the Gods that weaves an enormous about of aether
- The Nexus are conscious and often reach out to people to communicate information
- They can observe the city they are in and the areas surrounding it
- They can cast spells and interact with the world

# Daekar, the Nation of Knowledge and Truth
- Originally the people of Daekar lived in what is now called Old Daekar, when the Gods bestowed the Nexus of Life to a nearby forest, most of the population moved to Daekar taking a sapling of a special tree from Old Daekar, which they planted near the Nexus of Life
- The Nexus of Life caused the sapling to grow at an accelerated rate, and made it grow a lot bigger than normal trees, now the tree is nearly 1km tall and 200m in radius and many of the inhabitants have moved into the tree or onto the branches
- Daekar is ruled by a diarchy, the first ruler is the Archmage, who is the best magician in the human realm, the other is the Head Sage, who is the most intelligent
- Daekar contains the largest school in the material plains called the Daekar Academy of the Occult and Scholarly Practices, often just called the OSP or The Academy
- When a child is born, a Ritual of Divine Foresight is conducts, where the child's intelligence and magical potential are judged by the Nexus of Life, this is how the next generation of students of The Academy are selected, and the next generation of Head Sage and Archmage.
- The law is upheld by the Nexus of Life consciousness called Delphi, who they worship
- The majority of Daekar is a large forest, the land becomes easier to traverse towards Old Daekar though

# Mecha, the Nation of Mechanical Wonders
- Mecha is the newest nation in the material planes, having only existed for about 100 years
- The land originally belonged to an ancient civilisation who excelled at making mechanical contraptions, but they were eradicated by the gods for an unknown reason
- Mecha is the name of a mechanical bird that flies in the sky to collect aether from the Nexus of Wind, which is about 6km into the sky
- Mecha is a collaborative project between the engineers of 3 material planes in an effort to collect wind aether for Rituals, the area has become the epicentre of mechanical innovation and although Mecha has been flying for over 20 years, the ground teams have set up a permanent settlement refered to as Base Camp which continues to churn out new designs
- Not many crimes happen, but the law is upheld by combat mechs designed by the residents
- The majority of the land around Mecha is flat plains

# Vellir, the Nation of Wealth and Metal
- Vellir is a city made of metal suspended above a volcano in the Vellirian Mountains, while considered a city, no-one actually lives in Vellir due to the extreme heats, most people leave in underground caverns in the surrounding area, the city itself is an enormous metal refinery that uses the volcano's heat and the aether woven by the Nexus of Fire to work metal
- It was originally commissioned by a group of wealthy smithing companies who wanted to cut costs and expand production capabilities, there were 6 companies in total each of which have been passed down from generation to generation.
- The 8 founding companies now run the city as a sort of government called the Syndicate
- The law is upheld by mercenaries hired by the Syndicate to keep order
- The majority of the population live in severe poverty due to poor pay and lack of food

## Houses
### Seabane
The Seabane's were originally a family of sailors when one day a sea monster threatened their fishing village, the Seabanes of that time stepped up killing the monster and became renown sea monster slayers, amassing a great fleet over generations. When Vellir was originally founded, much of the fleet was pledged to the Syndicate and now the Seabane house act as the commanders of the Vellir Navy. The current head of house is Sasca Seabane.

### Landruld
The Landruld family were originally a large mining firm and were one of the original houses to propose the construction of Vellir. While their rise to power has been lost to time, the Landruld house are known for their lack of morals. They pledged many of the mining land around Vellir, and all of their workforce, now they are the biggest supplier of ore to Vellir and employ the largest amount of miners by far. The current head of house is Ulder Landruld.

### Blazebreath
The Blazebreath house got their name from an Dragonborn ancestor who took up the local smithy, she was known for using her breath to forge the some of the best weapons in the land, due to this the forge was not often lit and she gained the title "The Unlit Flame". She passed down the skills and part of her Dragonborn blood down to her decendants including Bethod Blazebreath, who helped invent the automated forge designs due Vellir's inception. The current head of house is Braldor Blazebreath

### Steelswift
Unlike the other houses, the Steelswift mantle is not passed down by a bloodline. Originally Steelswift was a name of a group of adventures who explored the Vellirian Mountains, absorbing aspiring adventurers along their journey, by the time they returned, while only 2 members of the original 5 returned the party now numbered over 100. When Vellir was being designed, the Steelswift house was offered a contract by the Syndicate to help run the city, which they accepted. They now make up a large amount of the hired mercenaries due to the contract and also run the Adventurer's Guild. To keep with tradition, the Steelswift's doors are open to any passionate adventurer. While the Steelswitft house doesn't really have a head of house many experienced adventurers within the Steelswift house can be found drinking in the Adventurer's Guild

### Nicklebloom
The Nicklebloom house started as a family of traders working between the Vellir-Daekar border, due to trade secrets they could smuggle almost anything into the Nation of Knowledge such as the illegal drug Knran. They became very wealthy due to their illegal practices and now dominate the Daekar and Vellir drugs market. They were the other house along with Landruld who proposed Daekar as they saw it as a good investment to increase profits, they financed the construction and hired the other 3 houses and hire the mercenary forces that work within the city. The current head of house is Nigel Nicklebloom

### Wheelsworth
The Wheelsworth house are a fragment of an ancient group of artisans and engineers who split off due to a disagreement about using magic to power mechanical devices, they are the main engineering and design company in Vellir and helped the Blazebreath house with the original designs for the forging system Vellir uses. When the Mecha project was announced 80 years ago, the majority of the Wheelsworth house left Vellir to work on the project and now they have a reduced influence and power over the city. The current head of house is Walter Wheelsworth, however the one presiding over the seat in the Syndicate is Wanda Wheelsworth, Walter's sister. 


## Gods
- There are only really two divine beings: the Light and the Dark, but when they appear to material beings they choose a form to appear in, which is what most people refer to as gods.
